  abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing
	has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making
	software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT
	hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas
	for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large
	capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human
	expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning
	for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus
	wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes
	wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover,
	companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as
	quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for
	one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This
	elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale,
	is unprecedented in the history of IT. The economies of scale of
	very large-scale datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource
	usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive
	to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet
	Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully
	scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue.
	Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns
	could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks
	of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing
	provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over
	a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due
	better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger
	scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies
	the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify
	Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles
	and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.},

  title = {Automated bidding in computational markets: an application in market-based

  journal = {Autonomous Agents and {Multi-Agent} Systems},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Abstract Autonomous agents are widely applied to automate interactions
	in robotics, e.g. for selling and purchasing goods on {eBay,} and
	in financial markets, e.g. in the form of quote machines and algorithmic
	traders. Current research investigates efficient economic mechanisms
	that fully automate the provisioning and usage processes of Grid-based
	services. On the one hand, consumers want to allocate resources on
	demand for their various applications, e.g. data sharing, stream
	processing, email, business applications and simulations. On the
	other hand, providers of Grid services want to govern business policies
	to meet their utilization and profit goals. The above-mentioned processes
	are not manually manageable, however, because decisions need to be
	taken within milliseconds. Therefore, such processes have to be automated
	to minimize human interactions. Hence, market mechanisms and strategic
	behavior play important roles when it comes to achieving automated
	and efficient allocation of Grid services. The paper begins by presenting
	a framework for automated bidding, providing a methodology for the
	design and implementation of configurable bidding strategies. Second,
	it presents a novel bidding strategy based on a reinforcement learning
	technique. This strategy is designed to automate the bid generation
	processes of consumers and providers in various market mechanisms.
	Third, the behavior and convergence of the strategy is evaluated
	in a centralized Continuous Double Auction and a decentralized on-line
	machine scheduling mechanism against selected benchmark bidding strategies.
	Fourth, we define a bidding language for communicating consumer and
	provider preferences to the market as well as report back the match
	of the market-based allocation process.},

	are finding in such patterns–phenomena that have fascinated naturalists
	for centuries–a fertile new approach to understanding biological
	systems: the study of self-organization. This book, a primer on self-organization
	in biological systems for students and other enthusiasts, introduces
	readers to the basic concepts and tools for studying self-organization
	and then examines numerous examples of self-organization in the natural
	world. Self-organization refers to diverse pattern formation processes
	in the physical and biological world, from sand grains assembling
	into rippled dunes to cells combining to create highly structured
	tissues to individual insects working to create sophisticated societies.
	What these diverse systems hold in common is the proximate means
	by which they acquire order and structure. In self-organizing systems,
	pattern at the global level emerges solely from interactions among
	lower-level components. Remarkably, even very complex structures
	result from the iteration of surprisingly simple behaviors performed
	by individuals relying on only local information. This striking conclusion
	suggests important lines of inquiry: To what degree is environmental
	rather than individual complexity responsible for group complexity?
	To what extent have widely differing organisms adopted similar, convergent
	strategies of pattern formation? How, specifically, has natural selection
	determined the rules governing interactions within biological systems?

	have gained wide-spread popularity. These devices will increasingly
	be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed mobile
	applications. These have to adapt to changes in context, such as
	variations in network bandwidth, exhaustion of battery power or reachability
	of services on other devices. We show how the construction of adaptive
	and context-aware mobile applications can be supported using a reflective
	middleware. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives
	to describe how context changes are handled using policies. These
	policies may conflict. In this paper, we classify the different types
	of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing. We argue that conflicts
	cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed,
	but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate
	a method by which these policy conflicts can be treated. This method
	uses a micro-economic approach that relies on a particular type of
	sealed-bid auction.},

  abstract = {Workflow management systems (WfMSs) have been used to support various
	types of business processes for more than a decade now. In workflows
	or Web processes for e-commerce and Web service applications, suppliers
	and customers define a binding agreement or contract between the
	two parties, specifying quality of service (QoS) items such as products
	or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and
	cost of services. The management of QoS metrics directly impacts
	the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Therefore,
	when services or products are created or managed using workflows
	or Web processes, the underlying workflow engine must accept the
	specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the
	QoS rendered to customers. In this paper, we present a predictive
	QoS model that makes it possible to compute the quality of service
	for workflows automatically based on atomic task QoS attributes.
	We also present the implementation of our QoS model for the METEOR
	workflow system. We describe the components that have been changed
	or added, and discuss how they interact to enable the management

	a language that looks much like a rule-based language with pre-conditions,

	A combination of tactics is called a strategy. There\&apos;s no justification
	for why a strategy is a separate concept from a tactic, as it serves
	no other purpose than be a simple composition of tactics. Selection
	amongst tactics is done via a utility function that maps each of

	with the maximum value is chosen. The actionable tactics are chosen
	on the basis of the pre-condition that fits the current observable

	has facilitated adaptation of software systems at runtime. Preserving
	the properties described by the architecture model during adaptation
	is an important task. We propose a self-adaptation approach that
	exploits architecture models to reason about and control adaptation
	at runtime. We can derive runtime models from design models facilitating

	must be supplemented with some redundancy to implement the mechanisms
	of self-adaptability: evaluation, model estimation, adaptation, and
	reconfiguration. However, we can reduce this overhead and improve
	overall system performance by: evaluating the behavior based on a

	their application code. Unfortunately, parallel programming is both
	time-consuming and error-prone. Second, the emerging Cloud Computing

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in building open distributed systems is to design
	mechanisms that compute optimal system-wide solutions despite the
	self-interest of individual users and computational agents. Classic
	game-theoretic solutions are often prohibitively expensive computationally.
	For example, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA) is an efficient
	and strategy-proof solution to the combinatorial allocation problem
	(CAP), in which agents demand bundles of items, but every agent must
	reveal its value for all possible bundles and the auctioneer must
	solve a sequence of NP-hard optimization problems to compute the
	outcome. I propose iBundle, an iterative combinatorial auction in
	which agents can bid for combinations of items and adjust their bids
	in response to bids from other agents. iBundle computes the efficient
	allocation in the CAP when agents follow myopic best-response bidding
	strategies, bidding for the bundle(s) that maximize their surplus
	taking the current prices as fixed. iBundle solves problems without
	complete information revelation from agents and terminates in competitive
	equilibrium. Moreover, an agent can follow a myopic best-response
	strategy with approximate values on bundles, for example with lower-
	and upper- bounds. My approach to iterative mechanism design decomposes
	the problem into two parts. First, I use linear programming theory
	to develop an efficient iterative auction under the assumption that
	agents will follow a myopic best-response bidding strategy. Second,
	I extend the approach to also compute Vickrey payments at the end
	of the auction. This makes myopic best-response a sequentially-rational
	strategy for agents in equilibrium, inheriting many of the useful
	game-theoretic properties of the GVA. iBundle implements a primal-dual
	algorithm, CombAuction, for the CAP, computing a feasible primal
	(the provisional allocation) and a feasible dual (the ask prices)
	that satisfy complementary slackness conditions. An extended auction,
	iBundle Extend & Adjust, interprets a primal-dual algorithm, VickAuction,
	as an iterative auction. VickAuction computes the efficient allocation
	and Vickrey payments with only best-response information from agents.
	Experimental results demonstrate that iBundle Extend & Adjust, which
	keeps iBundle open for a second phase before adjusting prices towards
	Vickrey payments, computes Vickrey payments across a suite of problems.},

	These algorithms have successfully been applied to solving many complex

	the quadratic assignment problem, the problem of network-traffic

	{INtelligence”} {(COIN).} A {COIN} is a large multi-agent system
	where: {\textbackslash}textlessbr /{\textbackslash}textgreater(i)
	There is little to no centralized communication or control; and {\textbackslash}textlessbr
	/{\textbackslash}textgreater(ii) There is a provided world utility
	function that rates the possible histories of the full system. {\textbackslash}textlessbr
	{/{\textbackslash}textgreaterIn} particular, we are interested in
	{COINs} in which each agent runs a reinforcement learning {(RL)}
	algorithm. Rather than use a conventional modeling approach (e.g.,
	model the system dynamics, and hand-tune agents to cooperate), we
	aim to solve the {COIN} design problem implicitly, via the “adaptive”
	character of the {RL} algorithms of each of the agents. This approach
	introduces an entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the
	{RL} algorithms are able to achieve high rewards, what reward functions
	for the individual agents will, when pursued by those agents, result
	in high world utility? In other words, what reward functions will
	best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the tragedy of the
	commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap? {\textbackslash}textlessbr
	{/{\textbackslash}textgreaterAlthough} still very young, research
	specifically concentrating on the {COIN} design problem has already
	resulted in successes in artificial domains, in particular in packet-routing,
	the leader-follower problem, and in variants of Arthur's El Farol
	bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon other
	disciplines related to {COINs,} this research will greatly expand
	the range of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition
	to drawing on them, such a fully developed scie nce of {COIN} design
	may provide much insight into other already established scientific
	fields, such as economics, game theory, and population biology.},

	as minimizers of local free energy functions. We show that a system

	(SMDP).Specifically, an ingress node adaptively performs connection
	admission and flow classification, whileeach core router performs
	joint bandwidth allocation and buffermanagement for the network classes.
	The main objective is to maximize average long term network revenue,
	and at the same time, effectively minimize average long term QoS
	violations. We use a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique
	to find the optimal policy for each DiffServ component. Simulation
	results show that our proposed solution not only performs well in

  abstract = {Quality attributes, e.g. performance and reliability, become more
	and more important for the development of software systems. One of
	the critical issues on quality assurance is how to make good enough
	tradeoffs between quality attributes that interfere with each other.
	Some architecture-based quality design and analysis methods are proposed
	to make tradeoffs at design time. However, many quality attributes
	depend on runtime contexts; it may be difficult and even impossible
	to make tradeoffs between them at design time. In this paper, we
	use an adaptive architecture model to capture candidate strategies
	for different quality attributes; the tradeoff, i.e. which strategies
	are more appropriate and thus applied, is postponed to runtime. The
	contribution of our approach is threefold. First, it makes use of
	existing architecture-based quality design and analysis methods to
	identify why and where quality attribute tradeoffs are necessary.
	Second, a traditional architecture description language is extended
	to support the modeling of an adaptive architecture, which records
	strategies for different quality attributes under different conditions.
	Third, a reflective middleware is used to monitor the runtime system,
	collect required information to determine appropriate strategies,
	and adapt the application's architecture to achieve expected quality
	attributes. This approach is demonstrated on {J2EE.}},
