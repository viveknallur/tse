  abstract = {Web services composition environment is highly dynamic with new services
	being deployed, existing ones becoming unavailable or their QoS and
	other non-functional properties (cost, availability, etc.) changing
	dynamically. However, current approaches for web services composition
	and execution, such as WS-BPEL, can neither tailor the execution
	automatically as per the required QoS nor can they adapt to the highly
	dynamic environment. Though there have been some recent efforts in
	this direction they are piecemeal and insufficient. They either do
	not take user's non-functional requirements (NFRs) into consideration
	for adaptation, or there is no standard way of specifying these requirements
	for a BPEL process. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach
	for dynamically adapting web service compositions based on NFRs.
	We first give a specification for representing NFRs for each partner
	service of a BPEL process, and then describe a system that dynamically
	adapts the BPEL process based on these requirements by selecting
	suitable services at runtime. The selected services only need to
	be semantically equivalent and the system automatically takes care
	of the syntactical differences between their interfaces. We integrated
	our system in an existing BPEL engine using aspect oriented approach
	and demonstrate via experiments that it has very little performance
	overhead even at high loads.},

  abstract = {With the development of the Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm,
	flexible business processes can be defined from independently developed
	services. Multiple services corresponding to the same functionality
	but characterized by different Quality of Service (QoS) attributes
	can be offered by different service providers and the best set of
	Web services can be selected at run-time in order to maximize the
	QoS for end users. In the literature many approaches have been proposed
	for the optimal service selection which is usually performed on a
	per-request basis, i.e., considering a single process invocation.
	In this paper we propose a broker-based framework which solves the
	optimal service selection on a per-flow basis. Multiple applications,
	defined as different BPEL processes are considered at the same time
	and multiple requests to the same process are optimized concurrently.
	Service selection is formulated as a constrained non-linear multi-criteria
	optimization problem and an heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine
	a scalable and efficient solution. A comparison with top performing
	state-of-the-art approaches for a number of different scenarios of
	interest is also provided. Results show that the overall optimization
	time reduction which can be achieved by our solution is proportional
	to the system incoming workload. Order of magnitudes optimization
	time improvements can be obtained if compared to alternative methods.
	Moreover, our solution is robust to workload prediction uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing
	has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making
	software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT
	hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas
	for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large
	capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human
	expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning
	for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus
	wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes
	wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover,
	companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as
	quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for
	one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This
	elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale,
	is unprecedented in the history of IT. The economies of scale of
	very large-scale datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource
	usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive
	to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet
	Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully
	scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue.
	Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns
	could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks
	of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing
	provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over
	a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due
	better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger
	scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies
	the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify
	Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles
	and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.},

	Computing (SOC) since it enables fulfilling complex user tasks while
	meeting Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. A challenging issue
	towards this purpose is the selection of the best set of services
	to compose, meeting global QoS constraints imposed by the user, which
	is known to be a NP-hard problem. This challenge becomes even more
	relevant when it is considered in the context of dynamic service
	environments. Indeed, two specific issues arise. First, required
	tasks are fulfilled on the fly, thus the time available for servicesâ
	selection and composition is limited. Second, service compositions
	have to be adaptive so that they can cope with changing conditions
	of the environment. In this paper, we present an efficient service
	selection algorithm that provides the appropriate ground for QoS-aware
	composition in dynamic service environments. Our algorithm is formed
	as a guided heuristic. The paper also presents a set of experiments
	conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, which shows
	its timeliness and optimality.},

  abstract = {Web service compositions are often used to realise service-based enterprise
	applications. These enterprise systems are built from many existing
	discreteapplications, often legacy applications exposed using Web
	service interfaces. Acceptance of these systems is often constrained
	by non-functional aspects,such as Quality of Service (QoS). A number
	of factors affect the QoS of anenterprise system, including availability,
	scalability and performance. Thereare a number of architectural configurations
	or distribution patterns, whichexpress how a composed system is to
	be deployed. These distribution patterns have a direct impact upon
	the QoS of the composition. However, the amount of code required
	to realise these distribution patterns is considerable. Additionally,
	there is an increased deployment time associated with setting updifferent
	distribution patterns. We therefore propose a novel approach whichcombines
	a Model Driven Architecture using UML 2.0 for modeling andsubsequently
	generating Web service compositions, with a method for achieving
	dynamic decentralised interaction amongst services with reduced deployment
	overheads. These approaches combined provide for the generation of

	of Quality of Service (QoS) and able to describe also the quality
	of the associated object. In order to allow applications adapting
	in front of degraded quality in a pre-determined way, all the nodes
	participating in a given business process shall coordinate their
	efforts in (i) deciding how to deal with service degradation/disruption,
	and in (ii) managing the overall quality (i.e., not only the Web-Service
	QoS but also the quality of the objects being delivered through the
	cooperative process). According to this rationale, one of the main
	goals of the Quadrantis project has been to investigate how to provide
	combined quality measurement of services and delivered objects, such
	as videos, voice, texts, or images. QoS modelling and management
	according to users' needs are presented. Users will access services
	according to QoS Contracts negotiated with service providers, while
	the streaming content is based on user profiles, to face a more dynamic
	management of QoS deviations in the Real Time provisioning level.
	In our approach, applications can request QoS, and react and repair
	to violations of the terms set forth in contracts or in expected
	delivery parameters, such as bandwidth or frame rate. To this extent,
	we present a framework for providing applications and services with
	QoS adaptation functionality, through the step-wise induction of
	a monitoring and recovery solutions at both Web-Services and streaming
	layers. The foundations of the merging between the two layers, which
	deal with very different aspects and protocols, are based on quality.},

  abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology
	(ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived
	vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water,
	electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all
	other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing
	service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of
	the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing
	paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as
	Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing
	and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented
	resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines
	(VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management
	strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management
	and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement
	(SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early
	thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global
	Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative
	Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along
	with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource
	allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology.
	Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance
	Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We
	also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global
	Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing
	Storage Clouds for high performance content delivery. Finally, we

	provide complex, adaptive functionality are currently one of the
	main development paradigms in software engineering. However, the
	Quality of Service (QoS) delivered by these systems remains an important
	concern, and needs to be managed in an equally adaptive and predictable
	way. To address this need, we introduce a novel, tool-supported framework
	for the development of adaptive service-based systems called QoSMOS
	(QoS Management and Optimization of Service-based systems). QoSMOS
	can be used to develop service-based systems that achieve their QoS
	requirements through dynamically adapting to changes in the system
	state, environment, and workload. QoSMOS service-based systems translate
	high-level QoS requirements specified by their administrators into
	probabilistic temporal logic formulae, which are then formally and
	automatically analyzed to identify and enforce optimal system configurations.
	The QoSMOS self-adaptation mechanism can handle reliability and performance-related
	QoS requirements, and can be integrated into newly developed solutions
	or legacy systems. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach
	are validated using simulations and a set of experiments based on
	an implementation of an adaptive service-based system for remote
	medical assistance.},

	are finding in such patternsâphenomena that have fascinated naturalists
	for centuriesâa fertile new approach to understanding biological
	systems: the study of self-organization. This book, a primer on self-organization
	in biological systems for students and other enthusiasts, introduces
	readers to the basic concepts and tools for studying self-organization
	and then examines numerous examples of self-organization in the natural
	world. Self-organization refers to diverse pattern formation processes
	in the physical and biological world, from sand grains assembling
	into rippled dunes to cells combining to create highly structured
	tissues to individual insects working to create sophisticated societies.
	What these diverse systems hold in common is the proximate means
	by which they acquire order and structure. In self-organizing systems,
	pattern at the global level emerges solely from interactions among
	lower-level components. Remarkably, even very complex structures
	result from the iteration of surprisingly simple behaviors performed
	by individuals relying on only local information. This striking conclusion
	suggests important lines of inquiry: To what degree is environmental
	rather than individual complexity responsible for group complexity?
	To what extent have widely differing organisms adopted similar, convergent
	strategies of pattern formation? How, specifically, has natural selection
	determined the rules governing interactions within biological systems?
	Broad in scope, thorough yet accessible, this book is a self-contained
	introduction to self-organization and complexity in biologyâa field
	of study at the forefront of life sciences research.},

	a method by which these policy conflicts can be treated. This method

	objectives. One common approach is to capture and represent human
	expertise in a form executable by a computer. Techniques to capture
	such expertise in programs, scripts, or rule sets are effective to
	an extent. However, they are often incapable of expressing the necessary
	adaptation expertise and emulating the subtleties of trade-offs in
	high-level decision making. In this paper, we propose a new language
	of adaptation that is sufficiently expressive to capture the subtleties
	of choice, deriving its ontology from system administration tasks
	and its underlying formalism from utility theory.},

  comment = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The} object
	of the paper is to present a mechanism for applications to self-adapt
	to changing circumstances. To this end, the authors present a language
	that looks much like a rule-based language with pre-conditions, action-to-be-taken
	and intended-effect. This triad is called a tactic. A combination
	of tactics is called a strategy. There\&apos;s no justification for
	why a strategy is a separate concept from a tactic, as it serves
	no other purpose than be a simple composition of tactics. Selection
	amongst tactics is done via a utility function that maps each of
	the post-conditions in an actionable tactic to a value and the tactic
	with the maximum value is chosen. The actionable tactics are chosen
	on the basis of the pre-condition that fits the current observable
	state of the software. Application of a tactic is called {adaptation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\&nbsp;{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;One}
	of the critical assumptions made in the paper (that I feel is rather
	weak) is that the preferences over objectives to be maximised are
	static. There is no real reason given for {this.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\&nbsp;{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Unanswered}
	questions are: How\&apos;re failures during adaptation handled? Should
	tactics be pre-emptable? {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Adaptability is an important requirement in the context of Web services
	to cater for the need of diverse set of client applications requesting
	customized view of consumed Web services to fit their own contexts
	and preferences. This paper presents an ongoing project to devise
	a novel service composition framework, named AdaptiveBPEL that leverages

	the service composition for dynamic change in order to provide a
	greater degree of configurability and dynamic adaptability of Web

	rules, and collaboration policies governing service interactions;
	2) provide different levels of functional and QoS offerings. The
	adaptation process is policy-driven to declaratively define the adaptive
	service behavior through dynamic injection of functional and non-functional

	In this paper we describe a system for developing architectural design

	architects in producing specific systems. The primary contributions
	of this research are: (a) a generic object model for representing
	architectural designs; (b) the characterization of architectural
	styles as specializations of this object model; and (c) a toolkit
	for creating an open architectural design environment from a description
	of a specific architectural style. We use our experience in implementing
	these conceptsto illustrate how style-oriented architectural design
	raises new challenges for software support environments.},

  abstract = {Service composition is highly desirable in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems
	where application services are naturally dispersed on distributed
	peers. However, it is challenging to provide high quality and failure
	resilient service composition in P2P systems due to the decentralization
	requirement and dynamic peer arrivals/departures. In this paper,
	we present an integrated P2P service composition framework called
	SpiderNet to address the challenges. At service setup phase, SpiderNet
	performs a novel bounded composition probing protocol to provide
	scalable quality-aware and resource-efficient service composition
	in a fully distributed fashion. Moreover, SpiderNet supports directed
	acyclic graph composition topologies and explores exchangeable composition
	orders for enhanced service quality. During service runtime, SpiderNet
	provides proactive failure recovery to overcome dynamic changes (e.g.,
	peer departures) in P2P systems. The proactive failure recovery scheme
	maintains a small number of dynamically selected backup compositions
	to achieve quick failure recovery for soft realtime streaming applications.
	We have implemented a prototype of SpiderNet and conducted extensive
	experiments using both large-scale simulations and wide-area network
	testbed. Experimental results show the feasibility and efficiency
	of the SpiderNet service composition solution for P2P systems.},

	of service parameters, effective adaptation requires specific information

  abstract = {This paper presents a Dynamic Composer for Web services. The services
	are enriched with semantic descriptions in OWL-S, based on which
	the Composer automatically creates a combination of services reaching
	a specified goal. As an example, a trip planning use case is chosen
	where the goal ranges from booking of a single flight to planning
	of an entire trip including flight, hotel, transport, etc. The composition
	is achieved using local and global algorithms satisfying specific
	quality of service (QoS) constraints and requirements such as the
	execution time or cost of the invoked Web services. At the same time
	a more extended HTN planning algorithm is discussed, matching not
	only service outputs to inputs but also satisfying service preconditions
	through effects. In addition to the automatic composition, the paper
	also proposes a recovery mechanism in case of unavailable services.
	When executing the composition of flight services, unavailable services
	are dynamically replaced by equivalent services or a new composition
	achieving the needed result. The presented platform and planning
	algorithms are put through extensive performance and scalability
	tests for typical trip booking scenarios, in which basic services
	are composed to a complex trip planning service.},

  abstract = {The process-driven composition of Web services is emerging as a promising
	approach to the integration of business applications within and across
	organizational boundaries. To support rapid and dynamic composition
	of services, Web services that meet users' functional requirements
	must be able to be located and bounded dynamically from a large and
	constantly changing number of service providers based on their quality
	of service (Qos). In order to enable quality-driven Web service selection,
	it is necessary to make a rational and effective decision among a
	number of similar Web services based on Qos criteria and users' preference.
	In this paper, we present a decision model of Qos criteria called
	DQos for evaluating Web services, which consists of an extensible
	Qos model, decision modes and constraints. On basis of systematic
	studying Qos criteria of Web service, service selection is formulated
	as multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem which can be
	solved by using subjective weight mode, single weight mode, objective
	weight mode and subjective-objective weight mode. At last, DQos model
	is proved to be feasible and effective by simulation experiments},

  title = {{Quality Adaptation in a Multisession Multimedia System: Model, Algorithms
	and Architecture}},
  school = {University of Victoria},
  year = {1998},
  abstract = {Flexible and adaptive quality of service (QoS) is desirable for real-time
	multi- media applications. Suppose a multimedia system is supporting
	a 30 frame/second video stream which is using a network bandwidth
	of 2 Mbps, and due to network congestion the network bandwidth is
	reduced to 1 Mbps. It is desirable that the system supports graceful
	adaptation of quality of the video stream, for example, by reducing
	the frame rate to 15 frame/second. The focus of this dissertation
	is to investigate the design of an adaptive multimedia system (AMS)
	with multiple concurrent sessions, where the quality of individual
	sessions is dynamically adapted to the available resources and to
	the run-time user preferences. We propose the Utility Model a mathematical
	model to capture the issues of re- source management within multisession
	AMSs. In this model, each session provides a quality pro le, which
	is a set of operating qualities arranged from the minimum acceptable
	quality to the maximum desired quality. Any operating quality may
	be mapped to the required resources using a quality-resource mapping,
	and also to a session utility using a quality-utility mapping. The
	main problem in a multisession AMS is to nd an operating quality
	for each session such that the overall system util- ity (e.g. system
	revenue) is maximized under the system resource constraints. This
	is called the adaptive multimedia problem (AMP). The Utility Model
	formulates the AMP as the multiple-choice multi-dimension 0-1 knapsack
	problem (MMKP). It provides a uni ed and computationally feasible
	way to solve the admission prob- lem for new multimedia sessions,
	and the dynamic quality adaptation and integrated resource allocation
	problems for existing sessions. We present the Padma Architecture
	a system architecture for multisession AMSs. This architecture has
	two novelties: (1) integrated and adaptive manage- ment of system
	resources based on the Utility Model, and (2) the use of metaspaces
	to encapsulate the machinery of quality adaptation. The former provides
	improved iii resource utilization and dynamic quality adaptation,
	and the latter provides the ap- plication programmers freedom from
	the concerns of low-level resource management issues while developing
	multimedia applications. Finally, we present the Utility Model Demonstration
	Prototype (UMDP) a prototype which demonstrates the capability of
	the Utility Model to handle admis- sion control, quality adaptation
	and integrated resource allocation in a uni ed way. We evaluate the
	performance of UMDP using random sequences of events, and show that
	the system utility achieved by the UMDP is signi cantly higher than
	that of a simple reservation model prototype (SRMP). For applications
	such multimedia ser- vice providers, it means that UMDP will generate
	more revenue than SRMP from the same amounts of system resources
	provisioned.},

	for the dynamic composition of Web services with quality of services
	(QoS) attributes. We adopt a concept of mediator to select credible
	services for service requestors. In our model, mediators evaluate
	services and assign trust ratings. A mediator includes a multi-dimensional
	quality model based on a set of non-functional properties that are
	transversal to all Web services, for example, their cost and reliability.
	In particular, we use the trust type inference rule to rate the trustworthy
	for selecting services optimally. Based on the QoS model, we present
	dynamic service selection approach to select and aggregate services
	to satisfy user's QoS requirements. This approach can be used to
	prune services that would be composed and thus avoid service composition
	execution plans that would be unacceptable to service requestors.},

  abstract = {In the next few decades, it is expected that web services will proliferate,
	many web services will offer the same services, and the clients will
	demand more value added and informative services rather than those
	offered by single, isolated web services. As the result, the problem
	of synthesizing web services of high quality will be raised as a
	prominent issue. The clients will face the trouble of choosing or
	creating composition plans, among numerous possible plans, that satisfy
	their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Typical QoS properties
	associated with a web service are the execution cost and time, availability,
	successful execution rate, reputation, and usage frequency. In engineering
	perspective, generating the composition plan that fulfills a client's
	QoS requirement is a time-consuming optimization problem. To resolve
	the problem in a timely manner, we propose a constraint satisfaction
	based web service composition algorithm that combines tabu search
	and simulated annealing meta-heuristics. As an implementation framework
	of the algorithm, we suggest a QoS-oriented web service composition
	planning architecture. The architecture maintains expert made composition
	schemas in a service category and assists the client as pure user
	to choose the one he/she wants to use. The main modules of the architecture
	are composition broker and execution plan optimizer. With the aid
	of the UDDI server, the composition broker discovers candidate outsourced
	web services for each atomic process of the selected schema and gathers
	QoS information on the web services. After that, the execution plan
	optimizer runs the web service composition algorithm in order to
	generate a QoS-oriented composition plan. The performance of the
	algorithm was tested in a simulated environment.},

	used for solving challenging optimization problems. But the increase
	in data and information has reduced the performance capacity of the
	GA, but highlighted the cost of finding a solution by GA. In addition,
	the genetic algorithm employed in previous literature is modeled
	to solve one problem exactly. The GA needs to be redesigned, at a
	cost, for it to be applied to another problem. For these two reasons,
	this paper proposes a method for incorporating the GA and rough set
	theory. The superiority of the proposed GA in this paper lies in
	its ability to model problems and explore solutions generically.
	The advantages of the proposed solution approach include: (i) solving
	problems that can be decomposed into functional requirements, and
	(ii) improving the performance of the GA by reducing the domain range
	of the initial population and constrained crossover using rough set
	theory. The solution approach is exemplified by solving the problem
	of web services composition, where currently the general analysis
	and selection of services can be excessively complex and un-systemic.
	Based on our experimental results, this approach has shown great
	promise and operates effectively.},

  abstract = {To be competitive, enterprises are collecting and analyzing increasingly
	large amount of data in order to derive business insights. However,
	there are at least two challenges to meet the increasing demand.
	First, the growth in the amount of data far outpaces the computation
	power growth of a uniprocessor. The growing gap between the supply
	and demand of computation power forces Enterprises to parallelize
	their application code. Unfortunately, parallel programming is both
	time-consuming and error-prone. Second, the emerging Cloud Computing
	paradigm imposes constraints on the underlying infrastructure, which
	forces enterprises to rethink their application architecture. We
	propose the {GridBatch} system, which aims at solving large-scale
	data-intensive batch problems under the Cloud infrastructure constraints.
	{GridBatch} is a programming model and associated library that hides
	the complexity of parallel programming, yet it gives the users complete
	control on how data are partitioned and how computation is distributed
	so that applications can have the highest performance possible. Through
	a real client example, we show that {GridBatch} achieves high performance
	in Amazon's {EC2} computing Cloud.},

	applications on the e-business processes, and with web services providing
	similar functional characteristics, Quality of Service (QoS) is the
	main factor to differentiate them. It is imperative to provide service
	consumers with facilities for selecting the only web services for
	their requirement according to their non-functional characteristics
	or QoS. However, the selection process is too greatly complicated
	to meet the requirement of business process. In this paper, the key
	business process performance model (KBPP) is proposed, and further,
	the issue of QoS driven service selection for dynamic web service
	composition is investigated. From the point of view of requirement
	of KBPP, an evaluation framework with KBPP is proposed, and a new
	approach to optimize the service selecting based on KBPP is presented.
	Experimental results show that the proposed approach greatly improves
	the service selection process in a dynamic and uncertain environment
	of web services. Simulative experiments are conducted to show the
	validity and efficiency of the methods.},

	distributed, self-included, self-described and modular. It possesses
	the attributes of well encapsulation and loose coupling. With the
	prevailing of Web service, how to select a set of services among
	large body of services with the same function in order to make the
	Composite Web Service achieve better performance and better quality
	is a hot issue in recent research. At the same time, with the dynamic
	environment of the Internet and business, it is difficult to choose
	the better and more precise service for the simple and static service
	choice model .So the dynamic choice of web service is quite important
	for the task. AS the research of Web Service gets deeper and deeper,
	the single service can't meet the need of the client. As the result,
	the Composite Web Service which can provide value-added functions
	has received a lot of attentions. So, the Web Service Composition
	emerges as the times require. In the study of QoS thesis analyzes
	current QoS models' advantages and disadvantages, which proposes
	a new, objective, reliable QoS model called the Dynamic QoS model
	(D-QoS model). There is a way which supports the management in the
	thesis. The approach is based on genetic algorithm and uses the D-QoS
	model to solve the composite optimization, there is a diminutive
	system in which we could prove that the model is feasible and ensure
	the deep popularization of the model.},

  abstract = {The skyrocketing demand for a new generation of cloud-based consumer

	of datacenters that must be massively scalable, efficient, agile,

	of the datacenters today and the evolution of the Intelligent Network
	(IN) infrastructure in telecommunication. The telecommunications
	networks have for many years, demonstrated their ability to reliably
	enable network (voice) services creation, assurance and delivery
	on a massive scale. Based on an analysis of the Intelligent Networks
	in telecommunications to identify proven concepts and key lessons
	that can be applied to enable next generation IT datacenters experience
	this paper asserts that: In order to scale cloud services reliably
	to millions of service developers and billions of end users the next
	generation cloud computing and datacenter infrastructure will have
	to follow an evolution similar to the one that led to the creation
	of scalable telecommunication networks. In the future network-based
	cloud service providers will leverage virtualization technologies
	to be able to allocate just the right levels of virtualized compute,
	network and storage resources to individual applications based on
	real-time business demand while also providing full service level
	assurance of availability, performance and security at a reasonable
	cost. A key component - identified in this paper as the Virtual Resource
	Mediation Layer (VRML), must be developed through industry collaboration
	to enable interoperability of various public and private clouds.
	This layer will form the basis for ensuring massive scalability of
	cloud infrastructure by enabling distributed service creation, service
	delivery and service assurance without any single vendor domination.
	The next generation virtualization technologies must allow applications
	to dynamically access CPU, memory, bandwidth and storage (capacity,
	I/O and throughput) in a manner similar to that of the telecommunications
	800 Service Call Model1 with one level of indirection and mediation.
	The authors believe that the next generation cloud evolution is a
	fundamental transformation and not just an evolutionary stack of
	XaaS implementations, which will enable global service collaboration
	networks utilizing optimally distributed and managed computing, network
	and storage resources driven in real-time by business priorities.},

	computational and storage resources on demand. Multiple commercial
	clouds already allow businesses to replace, or supplement, privately
	owned IT assets, alleviating them from the burden of managing and
	maintaining these facilities. However, there are issues that must
	be addressed before this vision of utility computing can be fully
	realized. In existing systems, customers are charged based upon the
	amount of resources used or reserved, but no guarantees are made
	regarding the application level performance or quality-of-service
	(QoS) that the given resources will provide. As cloud providers continue
	to utilize virtualization technologies in their systems, this can
	become problematic. In particular, the consolidation of multiple
	customer applications onto multicore servers introduces performance
	interference between collocated workloads, significantly impacting
	application QoS. To address this challenge, we advocate that the
	cloud should transparently provision additional resources as necessary
	to achieve the performance that customers would have realized if
	they were running in isolation. Accordingly, we have developed Q-Clouds,
	a QoS-aware control framework that tunes resource allocations to
	mitigate performance interference effects. Q-Clouds uses online feedback
	to build a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model that captures performance
	interference interactions, and uses it to perform closed loop resource
	management. In addition, we utilize this functionality to allow applications
	to specify multiple levels of QoS as application Q-states. For such
	applications, Q-Clouds dynamically provisions underutilized resources
	to enable elevated QoS levels, thereby improving system efficiency.
	Experimental evaluations of our solution using benchmark applications
	illustrate the benefits: performance interference is mitigated completely
	when feasible, and system utilization is improved by up to 35\% using
	Q-states.},

  year = {2001},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {A fundamental problem in building open distributed systems is to design
	mechanisms that compute optimal system-wide solutions despite the
	self-interest of individual users and computational agents. Classic
	game-theoretic solutions are often prohibitively expensive computationally.
	For example, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA) is an efficient
	and strategy-proof solution to the combinatorial allocation problem
	(CAP), in which agents demand bundles of items, but every agent must
	reveal its value for all possible bundles and the auctioneer must
	solve a sequence of NP-hard optimization problems to compute the
	outcome. I propose iBundle, an iterative combinatorial auction in
	which agents can bid for combinations of items and adjust their bids
	in response to bids from other agents. iBundle computes the efficient
	allocation in the CAP when agents follow myopic best-response bidding
	strategies, bidding for the bundle(s) that maximize their surplus
	taking the current prices as fixed. iBundle solves problems without
	complete information revelation from agents and terminates in competitive
	equilibrium. Moreover, an agent can follow a myopic best-response
	strategy with approximate values on bundles, for example with lower-
	and upper- bounds. My approach to iterative mechanism design decomposes
	the problem into two parts. First, I use linear programming theory
	to develop an efficient iterative auction under the assumption that
	agents will follow a myopic best-response bidding strategy. Second,
	I extend the approach to also compute Vickrey payments at the end
	of the auction. This makes myopic best-response a sequentially-rational
	strategy for agents in equilibrium, inheriting many of the useful
	game-theoretic properties of the GVA. iBundle implements a primal-dual
	algorithm, CombAuction, for the CAP, computing a feasible primal
	(the provisional allocation) and a feasible dual (the ask prices)
	that satisfy complementary slackness conditions. An extended auction,
	iBundle Extend & Adjust, interprets a primal-dual algorithm, VickAuction,
	as an iterative auction. VickAuction computes the efficient allocation
	and Vickrey payments with only best-response information from agents.
	Experimental results demonstrate that iBundle Extend & Adjust, which
	keeps iBundle open for a second phase before adjusting prices towards
	Vickrey payments, computes Vickrey payments across a suite of problems.},

	An open issue of HMAS is to give holons means of self-organization

	of complex systems using a holonic organizational approach. This
	paper introduces the concept of capacity as the description of agents
	know-how. This concept allows the representation and reasoning about

  abstract = {Adaptive Web systems (AWS) are Web-based systems that can adapt their
	features such as, presentation, content, and structure, based on
	users' behaviour and preferences, device capabilities, and environment
	attributes. A framework was developed in our research group to provide
	the necessary components and protocols for the development of adaptive
	Web systems; however, there were several issues and shortcomings
	(e.g. low productivity, lack of verification mechanisms, etc.) in
	using the framework that inspired the development of a domain-specific
	language for the framework. This paper focuses on the proposal, design,
	and implementation of AWL, the Adaptive Web Language, which is used
	to develop adaptive Web systems within our framework. Not only does
	AWL address the existing issues in the framework, but it also offers
	mechanisms to increase software quality attributes, especially, reusability.
	An example application named PENS (a personalized e-News system)
	is explained and implemented in AWL. AWL has been designed based
	on the analysis of the adaptive Web domain, having taken into account
	the principles of reuse-based software engineering (product-lines),
	domain-specific languages, and aspect-oriented programming. Specially,
	a novel design decision, inspired by aspect-oriented programming
	paradigm, allows separate specification of presentation features
	in an application from its adaptation features. The AWL's design
	decisions and their benefits are explained.},

	of different users. This allows for reusability of a service in different
	contexts and achieves a level of adaptiveness and contextualization
	without recoding and recompiling of the overall composed services.
	The execution semantics of the adaptive composite service is provided
	by an event-driven model. This execution model is based on Linda
	Tuple Spaces and supports real-time and asynchronous communication
	between services. Three core services, coordination service, context
	service, and event service, are implemented to automatically schedule
	and execute the component services, and adapt to user configured
	exceptions and contexts at run time. The proposed system provides
	an efficient and flexible support for specifying, deploying, and
	accessing adaptive composite services. We demonstrate the benefits
	of our system by conducting usability and performance studies.},

	how to allocate resources reasonably to cater requirements from both
	sides attracts wide attentions. Based on game theory, we introduce
	a new Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Allocation algorithm to solve resource
	management problem in cloud computing. This algorithm fully considers
	several criteria such as the heterogeneous distribution of resources,
	rational exchange behaviors of cloud users, incomplete common information
	and dynamic successive allocation. Compared to former researches,
	experimental results presented in this paper show that even though
	rivalsâ information is uncertain, cloud users can receive Nash
	equilibrium allocation solutions by gambling stage by stage. Furthermore,
	the resource price evaluated by the algorithm will converge to the
	optimal price at the end of the gambling sequence.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a new emerging computing paradigm that advocates
	supplying users everything as a service. Compared with grid computing,
	the focus of resource management problem is transformed to resource
	virtualization and allocation rather than job decomposition and scheduling.
	It is more urgent to find better solutions for cloud resource allocation
	than ever before. Although there have been some research efforts
	in grid computing, most of them aim at maximizing utility of system
	and lack of analysis for competition between different users. Some
	researches consider competition analysis, but they assume that common
	knowledge is certain and known for every user, which is difficult
	to be applied in a global distributed cloud environment. In this
	paper, we hereby propose a new resource pricing and allocation policy
	where users can predict the future resource price as well as satisfy
	budget and deadline constraints. Experimental results prove that
	resource price can gradually converge to an equilibrium state by
	dynamic games and that cloud users can receive Nash equilibrium allocation
	proportion without other competitors' bidding information.},

	task in dynamic WSC, for it directly determines the composite quality
	of service (QoS). But most existing services selection methods use
	"best-effort" strategies to serve the service requesters. These strategies
	focus so heavily on requester's interests that brings inefficiency
	to resources, because the requesters greedily compete to get the
	"best" service. Besides, the impartiability of a composite service
	should not be ignored. Therefore, an "on-demand" services selection
	strategy is put forward by treating the service requesters and providers
	as buyers and sellers in commodity-market environment. And considering
	the integration of a composite service, the services selection is
	modeling as a 0-1 multidimensional knapsack problem. Furthermore,
	referring to "price-demand rule" in commodity-market, the services
	selection model is improved for resources load balance. Finally,
	experiments have shown that commodity-market based service selection
	can bring load balance and be helpful for resources utility.},

	A QoS constrained resource allocation problem is considered in this

	computing problem by requesting the usage of resources across a cloud-based
	network, and a cost of each computational service depends on the
	amount of computation. Game theory is used to solve the problem of
	resource allocation. A practical approximated solution with the following
	two steps is proposed. First, each participant solves its optimal
	problem independently, without consideration of the multiplexing
	of resource assignments. A Binary Integer Programming method is proposed
	to solve the independent optimization. Second, an evolutionary mechanism
	is designed, which changes multiplexed strategies of the initial
	optimal solutions of different participants with minimizing their
	efficiency losses. The algorithms in the evolutionary mechanism take
	both optimization and fairness into account. It is demonstrated that
	Nash equilibrium always exists if the resource allocation game has
	feasible solutions.},

	where: {\\textless}br /{\\textgreater}(i) There is little to no centralized

	There is a provided world utility function that rates the possible
	histories of the full system. {\\textless}br {/{\\textgreater}In}
	particular, we are interested in {COINs} in which each agent runs
	a reinforcement learning {(RL)} algorithm. Rather than use a conventional
	modeling approach (e.g., model the system dynamics, and hand-tune
	agents to cooperate), we aim to solve the {COIN} design problem implicitly,
	via the âadaptiveâ character of the {RL} algorithms of each of
	the agents. This approach introduces an entirely new, profound design
	problem: Assuming the {RL} algorithms are able to achieve high rewards,
	what reward functions for the individual agents will, when pursued
	by those agents, result in high world utility? In other words, what
	reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like
	the tragedy of the commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap?
	{\\textless}br {/{\\textgreater}Although} still very young, research
	specifically concentrating on the {COIN} design problem has already
	resulted in successes in artificial domains, in particular in packet-routing,
	the leader-follower problem, and in variants of Arthur's El Farol
	bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon other
	disciplines related to {COINs,} this research will greatly expand
	the range of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition
	to drawing on them, such a fully developed scie nce of {COIN} design
	may provide much insight into other already established scientific

  abstract = {In software service provision, the overall performance of a composite
	service is often the ultimate focus of concern rather than those
	of its individual components. This opens new opportunities for resource
	allocation because with its service workflow definition, more accurate
	prediction of its individual components' dynamic workload is possible,
	thus resulting in better utilization of resources. In this paper,
	we propose to improve resource allocation through tracing and prediction
	of workload dynamics of component services as requests traverse and
	pipeline through the workflow. Factors affecting service workload
	such as service time, transition probability, replication overhead
	for additional service etc. as well as the uncertainty in request
	arrival time are all taken into consideration in our model. The goal
	is to maximize the number of requests completed under the constraints
	of limited available resources. Experimental study on TPC-W and synthetic
	workflow shows that our dynamic workflow-based resource allocation
	scheme is much more efficient in enhancing the overall performance
	of composite services than current resource allocation schemes do.

	Application Integration (EAI) and more and more applications based

	in business applications such as logistics is services composition
	automatically and efficiently. In this paper, we present a Dynamic,
	Demand-Driven Web services Engine called D3D-Serv to implement composite
	service functionality that is used to dynamically build composite
	services from existing services according to different business logics
	and requirements. In this D3D-Serv framework, the most challenging
	function to implement is dynamic selection of service providers at
	run time. The highly dynamic and distributed nature of Web services
	often makes some service providers overloaded at certain times while
	others idle. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient services
	selection and execution strategy that is based on the queuing theory
	and can provide guarantees for the QOS (Quality of Service) under
	provider's limited resources. Preliminary experimental results have
	shown that this algorithm is effective.},

  abstract = {Efficient management of service level agreements which specify mutually-agreed
	understandings and expectations of service provision has been a subject
	of research for a few years. A critical issue in this area is for
	service consumers and service providers to effectively achieve agreements
	on non-functional aspects of service provision, such as quality of
	service. However, this issue has not been well addressed, especially
	in the context of service composition provision which implies the
	establishment of a set of interrelated agreements on quality of service
	between the service consumer and multiple service providers offering
	various services in the composition. There is a lack of supporting
	frameworks and techniques to automatically and dynamically achieve
	agreements on quality of service constraints for individual services
	in a service composition, aiming at fulfilling compositions end-to-end
	quality of service requirements. This paper reports the authors recent
	research in addressing this issue, using the agent technology. In
	this research, the service level agreements for a service composition
	are established through autonomous agent negotiation. To enable this,
	an innovative framework is proposed in which the service consumer
	is represented by a set of agents who negotiate quality of service
	constraints with the service providers for various services in the
	composition. This negotiation is well coordinated in order to achieve
	end-to-end quality of service requirements. Based on this framework,
	a new negotiation protocol is presented to support coordinated negotiation.
	A utility-function-based decision-making model is proposed based
	on which agents can proactively decide on the course of further actions.
	Moreover, this paper also contributes the novel design of the negotiation
	Web service on the service providers side for the purpose of interoperability.
	Finally, the prototype implementation for the purpose of proof-of-concept
	is discussed.},
