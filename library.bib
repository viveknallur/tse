@book{Dustdar2009,
abstract = {Complex service-oriented systems comprise humans and software services spanning multiple organizations. These systems are highly dynamic, because services, processes, and teams are not only diverse but they also constantly evolve. Therefore, these systems introduce a variety of challenges on how to adapt services, processes, and teams to changing situations. We contribute with our approach to address these challenges, comprising model-driven compliance support, run-time interaction mining, run-time management of requirements, and an explicit control-loop architecture. We conclude with remaining issues the software and service engineering research community should address.},

We provide an overview of basic bone biology and graft classifications that are frequently used in these procedures. In it, we present the three different properties of bone grafting materials, including osteoinduction, osteogenesis and osteoconduction. And we describe different types of bone grafting materials, including natural and artificial bone sources.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach for dynamic autonomous resource management in computing clouds. The main contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we adopt a distributed architecture where resource management is decomposed into independent tasks, each of which is performed by Autonomous Node Agents that are tightly coupled with the physical machines in a data center. Second, the Autonomous Node Agents carry out configurations in parallel through Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis using the PROMETHEE method. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is promising in terms of scalability, feasibility and flexibility.},

abstract = {What we know is less important than our capacity to continue to learn more until e-learning appeared. While e-learning technology has matured considerably since its inception, there are still many problems that practitioners find when come to implementing e-learning. Today's knowledge society of the 21st century requires a flexible learning environment which is capable to adapt according to teaching and learning objectives, students' profiles and preferences for information and communication technologies and services. Advances in technology offer new opportunities in enhancing teaching and learning. Many advances in learning technologies are taking place throughout the world. The new technologies enable individuals to personalize the environment in which they work or learn, utilizing a range of tools to meet their interests and needs. Research community has believed that an e-learning ecosystem is the next generation e-learning but has faced challenges in optimizing resource allocations, dealing with dynamic demands on getting information and knowledge anywhere and anytime, handling rapid storage growth requirements, cost controlling and greater flexibility. Additionally, e-learning ecosystems need to improve its infrastructure, which can devote the required computation and storage resources for e-learning ecosystems. So, we need flourish, growing, up-to-date and strong infrastructure e-learning ecosystems in a productive and cost-effective way to be able to face rapidly-changing environments. In this paper, an e-learning ecosystem (ELES) which supports modern technologies is introduced and implemented. An integration between cloud computing and Web 2.0 technologies and services will be used to support the development of e-learning ecosystems; cloud computing as an adoptable technology for many of the organizations with its dynamic scalability and usage of virtualized resources as a service through the Internet. Web 2.0 brings new instruments help building dynamic- - e-learning ecosystem on the web.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a new emerging computing paradigm that advocates supplying users everything as a service. Compared with grid computing, the focus of resource management problem is transformed to resource virtualization and allocation rather than job decomposition and scheduling. It is more urgent to find better solutions for cloud resource allocation than ever before. Although there have been some research efforts in grid computing, most of them aim at maximizing utility of system and lack of analysis for competition between different users. Some researches consider competition analysis, but they assume that common knowledge is certain and known for every user, which is difficult to be applied in a global distributed cloud environment. In this paper, we hereby propose a new resource pricing and allocation policy where users can predict the future resource price as well as satisfy budget and deadline constraints. Experimental results prove that resource price can gradually converge to an equilibrium state by dynamic games and that cloud users can receive Nash equilibrium allocation proportion without other competitors' bidding information.},

However, services as well as services compositions are designed in such a way that quality of services (QoS) policy cannot be dynamically adapted to the users needs. In fact, services and services compositions encapsulate the domain-specific business logic served by company IS, and orthogonal requirements called quality of services such as security, logging, and transaction. To adapt, in a dynamic way, the QoS to the business-logic of services in the services composition, we propose to deal with two kinds of services; business and quality early in the process. In this paper, we propose an intentional process that enables to differentiate a business service and quality of service, in a goal driven manner. The QoS is considered as a potential aspect. The paper presents the approach and illustrates it with a medical case study.},

@article{Agarwal2010,
abstract = {Web services composition environment is highly dynamic with new services being deployed, existing ones becoming unavailable or their QoS and other non-functional properties (cost, availability, etc.) changing dynamically. However, current approaches for web services composition and execution, such as WS-BPEL, can neither tailor the execution automatically as per the required QoS nor can they adapt to the highly dynamic environment. Though there have been some recent efforts in this direction they are piecemeal and insufficient. They either do not take user's non-functional requirements (NFRs) into consideration for adaptation, or there is no standard way of specifying these requirements for a BPEL process. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for dynamically adapting web service compositions based on NFRs. We first give a specification for representing NFRs for each partner service of a BPEL process, and then describe a system that dynamically adapts the BPEL process based on these requirements by selecting suitable services at runtime. The selected services only need to be semantically equivalent and the system automatically takes care of the syntactical differences between their interfaces. We integrated our system in an existing BPEL engine using aspect oriented approach and demonstrate via experiments that it has very little performance overhead even at high loads.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for Web Service composition and coordination based on connectors which are defined by Web Service client and automatically generated by the COMPOSITOR tool we have developed. Connectors use contracts to express the non-functional requirements and the behaviour desired by the client of a service, such as QoS (Quality of Service) features. The connectors generated are self-adaptive. The adaptation enactment is based on using an OWL ontology of the server domain which makes it possible to adapt any mismatch in a call to a service at run-time when the server is updated or replaced.},

@article{Agarwal2010a,
abstract = {Web services composition environment is highly dynamic with new services being deployed, existing ones becoming unavailable or their QoS and other non-functional properties (cost, availability, etc.) changing dynamically. However, current approaches for web services composition and execution, such as WS-BPEL, can neither tailor the execution automatically as per the required QoS nor can they adapt to the highly dynamic environment. Though there have been some recent efforts in this direction they are piecemeal and insufficient. They either do not take user's non-functional requirements (NFRs) into consideration for adaptation, or there is no standard way of specifying these requirements for a BPEL process. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for dynamically adapting web service compositions based on NFRs. We first give a specification for representing NFRs for each partner service of a BPEL process, and then describe a system that dynamically adapts the BPEL process based on these requirements by selecting suitable services at runtime. The selected services only need to be semantically equivalent and the system automatically takes care of the syntactical differences between their interfaces. We integrated our system in an existing BPEL engine using aspect oriented approach and demonstrate via experiments that it has very little performance overhead even at high loads.},

abstract = {Web services- Web-accessible programs and devices are a key application area for the Semantic Web. With the proliferation of Web services and the evolution towards the Semantic Web comes the opportunity to automate various Web services tasks. Our objective is to enable markup and automated reasoning technology to describe, simulate, compose, test, and verify compositions of Web services. We take as our starting point the DAML-S DAML+OIL ontology for describing the capabilities of Web services. We define the semantics for a relevant subset of DAML-S in terms of a first-order logical language. With the semantics in hand, we encode our service descriptions in a Petri Net formalism and provide decision procedures for Web service simulation, verification and composition. We also provide an analysis of the complexity of these tasks under different restrictions to the DAML-S composite services we can describe. Finally, we present an implementation of our analysis techniques. This implementation takes as input a DAML-S description of a Web service, automatically generates a Petri Net and performs the desired analysis. Such a tool has broad applicability both as a back end to existing manual Web service composition tools, and as a stand-alone tool for Web service developers.},

Companies have to meet customer expectations and control IT costs to stay competitive. For this, flexible and agile business processes, efficiently supported by IT systems are crucial. Web Services as an upcoming technology become more and more important establishing cross-organizational workflows. Due to a large amount of incoming requests, it is crucial to plan the workflow control. Furthermore, the re- source usage has to be addressed in order to support scalability. Thus, capacity planning mechanisms are crucial for adapting a workflow to the real behavior ensuring that its execution remains feasible and SLA violations due to overload are avoided. Capacity planning requires among others a workload forecast as well as a workload modeling and analysis. Therefore, in this paper we present a holistic capacity planning and cost-effective approach for Web Service workflow parallelization and optimization},

abstract = {Efficient management of service level agreements which specify mutually-agreed understandings and expectations of service provision has been a subject of research for a few years. A critical issue in this area is for service consumers and service providers to effectively achieve agreements on non-functional aspects of service provision, such as quality of service. However, this issue has not been well addressed, especially in the context of service composition provision which implies the establishment of a set of interrelated agreements on quality of service between the service consumer and multiple service providers offering various services in the composition. There is a lack of supporting frameworks and techniques to automatically and dynamically achieve agreements on quality of service constraints for individual services in a service composition, aiming at fulfilling compositions end-to-end quality of service requirements. This paper reports the authors recent research in addressing this issue, using the agent technology. In this research, the service level agreements for a service composition are established through autonomous agent negotiation. To enable this, an innovative framework is proposed in which the service consumer is represented by a set of agents who negotiate quality of service constraints with the service providers for various services in the composition. This negotiation is well coordinated in order to achieve end-to-end quality of service requirements. Based on this framework, a new negotiation protocol is presented to support coordinated negotiation. A utility-function-based decision-making model is proposed based on which agents can proactively decide on the course of further actions. Moreover, this paper also contributes the novel design of the negotiation Web service on the service providers side for the purpose of interoperability. Finally, the prototype implementation for the purpose of proof-of-concept is discussed.},

abstract = {Future complex architectures for Web-Services-based delivery of services and objects require applications able to deal with different levels of Quality of Service (QoS) and able to describe also the quality of the associated object. In order to allow applications adapting in front of degraded quality in a pre-determined way, all the nodes participating in a given business process shall coordinate their efforts in (i) deciding how to deal with service degradation/disruption, and in (ii) managing the overall quality (i.e., not only the Web-Service QoS but also the quality of the objects being delivered through the cooperative process). According to this rationale, one of the main goals of the Quadrantis project has been to investigate how to provide combined quality measurement of services and delivered objects, such as videos, voice, texts, or images. QoS modelling and management according to users' needs are presented. Users will access services according to QoS Contracts negotiated with service providers, while the streaming content is based on user profiles, to face a more dynamic management of QoS deviations in the Real Time provisioning level. In our approach, applications can request QoS, and react and repair to violations of the terms set forth in contracts or in expected delivery parameters, such as bandwidth or frame rate. To this extent, we present a framework for providing applications and services with QoS adaptation functionality, through the step-wise induction of a monitoring and recovery solutions at both Web-Services and streaming layers. The foundations of the merging between the two layers, which deal with very different aspects and protocols, are based on quality.},

CoDiGA is characterized by good stability and quick convergence. In CoDiGA, an enhanced initial population policy and an evolution policy are proposed based on population diversity and a relation matrix coding scheme. The integration of the two policies overcomes shortcomings resulting from randomicity of genetic algorithm, such as slow convergence, great variance among the running results, soaring overhead along with increasing size of composition. The simulation results on web service selection with global QoS constraints have shown that prematurity was overcomed effectively, and convergence and stability of genetic algorithm were improved greatly.},

abstract = {In software service provision, the overall performance of a composite service is often the ultimate focus of concern rather than those of its individual components. This opens new opportunities for resource allocation because with its service workflow definition, more accurate prediction of its individual components' dynamic workload is possible, thus resulting in better utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose to improve resource allocation through tracing and prediction of workload dynamics of component services as requests traverse and pipeline through the workflow. Factors affecting service workload such as service time, transition probability, replication overhead for additional service etc. as well as the uncertainty in request arrival time are all taken into consideration in our model. The goal is to maximize the number of requests completed under the constraints of limited available resources. Experimental study on TPC-W and synthetic workflow shows that our dynamic workflow-based resource allocation scheme is much more efficient in enhancing the overall performance of composite services than current resource allocation schemes do. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Adaptive Web systems (AWS) are Web-based systems that can adapt their features such as, presentation, content, and structure, based on users' behaviour and preferences, device capabilities, and environment attributes. A framework was developed in our research group to provide the necessary components and protocols for the development of adaptive Web systems; however, there were several issues and shortcomings (e.g. low productivity, lack of verification mechanisms, etc.) in using the framework that inspired the development of a domain-specific language for the framework. This paper focuses on the proposal, design, and implementation of AWL, the Adaptive Web Language, which is used to develop adaptive Web systems within our framework. Not only does AWL address the existing issues in the framework, but it also offers mechanisms to increase software quality attributes, especially, reusability. An example application named PENS (a personalized e-News system) is explained and implemented in AWL. AWL has been designed based on the analysis of the adaptive Web domain, having taken into account the principles of reuse-based software engineering (product-lines), domain-specific languages, and aspect-oriented programming. Specially, a novel design decision, inspired by aspect-oriented programming paradigm, allows separate specification of presentation features in an application from its adaptation features. The AWL's design decisions and their benefits are explained.},

Moreover, it implements a database supported WS intermediary (Broker) that it is also possible to store quality of service (QoS) information for WSs. A selection module is also presented that delivers the WS that maximizes the value of QoS characteristics among others with the same functionality. An experimental prototype is presented and evaluated in the scenario of air ticket issuing WS selection.},

abstract = {Abstract: In the web services environment, service level agreements (SLA) refers to mutually agreed understandings and expectations between service consumers and providers on the service provision. Although management of SLA is critical to wide adoption of web services technologies in the real world, support for it is very limited nowadays, especially in web service composition scenarios. There lacks adequate frameworks and technologies supporting various SLA operations such as SLA formation, enforcement, and recovery. This paper presents a novel agent-based framework which utilises the agents ability of negotiation, interaction, and cooperation to facilitate autonomous SLA management in the context of service composition provision. Based on this framework, mechanisms for autonomous SLA operations are proposed and discussed. Results from simulations show that by integrating agents and web services the framework can address issues of SLA management drawn from sophisticated service composition scenarios.

@article{Liang2009,
abstract = {Evolutionary computing (EC) techniques have been used traditionally used for solving challenging optimization problems. But the increase in data and information has reduced the performance capacity of the GA, but highlighted the cost of finding a solution by GA. In addition, the genetic algorithm employed in previous literature is modeled to solve one problem exactly. The GA needs to be redesigned, at a cost, for it to be applied to another problem. For these two reasons, this paper proposes a method for incorporating the GA and rough set theory. The superiority of the proposed GA in this paper lies in its ability to model problems and explore solutions generically. The advantages of the proposed solution approach include: (i) solving problems that can be decomposed into functional requirements, and (ii) improving the performance of the GA by reducing the domain range of the initial population and constrained crossover using rough set theory. The solution approach is exemplified by solving the problem of web services composition, where currently the general analysis and selection of services can be excessively complex and un-systemic. Based on our experimental results, this approach has shown great promise and operates effectively.},

One of the most challenging objectives to be achieved within these environments is to assist users in realizing tasks that integrate on the fly functionalities of the networked services opportunely according to the current pervasive environment. Towards this purpose, we present COCOA, a solution for COnversation-based service COmposition in pervAsive computing environments with QoS support. COCOA provides COCOA-L, an OWL-S based language for the semantic, QoS-aware specification of services and tasks, which further allows the specification of services and tasks conversations. Moreover, COCOA provides two mechanisms: COCOA-SD for the QoS-aware semantic service discovery and COCOA-CI for the QoS-aware integration of service conversations towards the realization of the user tasks conversation. The distinctive feature of COCOA is the ability of integrating on the fly the conversations of networked services to realize the conversation of the user task, by further meeting the QoS requirements of user tasks. Thereby, COCOA allows the dynamic realization of user tasks according to the specifics of the pervasive computing environment in terms of available services and by enforcing valid service consumption.},

@article{Alrifai2009a,
abstract = {The run-time binding of web services has been recently put forward in order to support rapid and dynamic web service compositions. With the growing number of alternative web services that provide the same functionality but differ in quality parameters, the service composition becomes a decision problem on which component services should be selected such that user's end-to-end QoS requirements (e.g. availability, response time) and preferences (e.g. price) are satisfied. Although very efficient, local selection strategy fails short in handling global QoS requirements. Solutions based on global optimization, on the other hand, can handle global constraints, but their poor performance renders them inappropriate for applications with dynamic and real-time requirements. In this paper we address this problem and propose a solution that combines global optimization with local selection techniques to benefit from the advantages of both worlds. The proposed solution consists of two steps: first, we use mixed integer programming (MIP) to find the optimal decomposition of global QoS constraints into local constraints. Second, we use distributed local selection to find the best web services that satisfy these local constraints. The results of experimental evaluation indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of computation time while achieving close-to-optimal results.},

abstract = {QoS-aware service composition is a key requirement in Service Oriented Computing (SOC) since it enables fulfilling complex user tasks while meeting Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. A challenging issue towards this purpose is the selection of the best set of services to compose, meeting global QoS constraints imposed by the user, which is known to be a NP-hard problem. This challenge becomes even more relevant when it is considered in the context of dynamic service environments. Indeed, two specific issues arise. First, required tasks are fulfilled on the fly, thus the time available for services’ selection and composition is limited. Second, service compositions have to be adaptive so that they can cope with changing conditions of the environment. In this paper, we present an efficient service selection algorithm that provides the appropriate ground for QoS-aware composition in dynamic service environments. Our algorithm is formed as a guided heuristic. The paper also presents a set of experiments conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, which shows its timeliness and optimality.},

abstract = {Software as a service (SaaS) can be delivered by composing software applications using web services hosted in one or more administrative domains. In this context, web service composition has a considerable impact on the delivered service affecting its quality (QoS). There is therefore a need to keep the service QoS parameters under control when the service is delivered by a combination of different web services. This paper investigates the composition of web services, and its implications on the overall QoS guarantees as represented by the service response times, when autonomic computing control mechanisms are in place. A control based approach of the autonomic computing concept is used to investigate the dynamic composition of web services when the service is provided by a set of web services linked via cooperation protocols that define a global process choreography. Web services are modeled as scheduled computational processes waiting in a queue to cooperate in delivering the service. The paper proposes an input-state-output mathematical model for web services and further investigates, in this context, their composition hypothesis, principles, and rules.},

abstract = {Web service compositions are often used to realise service-based enterprise applications. These enterprise systems are built from many existing discreteapplications, often legacy applications exposed using Web service interfaces. Acceptance of these systems is often constrained by non-functional aspects,such as Quality of Service (QoS). A number of factors affect the QoS of anenterprise system, including availability, scalability and performance. Thereare a number of architectural configurations or distribution patterns, whichexpress how a composed system is to be deployed. These distribution patterns have a direct impact upon the QoS of the composition. However, the amount of code required to realise these distribution patterns is considerable. Additionally, there is an increased deployment time associated with setting updifferent distribution patterns. We therefore propose a novel approach whichcombines a Model Driven Architecture using UML 2.0 for modeling andsubsequently generating Web service compositions, with a method for achieving dynamic decentralised interaction amongst services with reduced deployment overheads. These approaches combined provide for the generation of dynamic Web service compositions driven by a distribution pattern model.},

abstract = {Service composition is highly desirable in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems where application services are naturally dispersed on distributed peers. However, it is challenging to provide high quality and failure resilient service composition in P2P systems due to the decentralization requirement and dynamic peer arrivals/departures. In this paper, we present an integrated P2P service composition framework called SpiderNet to address the challenges. At service setup phase, SpiderNet performs a novel bounded composition probing protocol to provide scalable quality-aware and resource-efficient service composition in a fully distributed fashion. Moreover, SpiderNet supports directed acyclic graph composition topologies and explores exchangeable composition orders for enhanced service quality. During service runtime, SpiderNet provides proactive failure recovery to overcome dynamic changes (e.g., peer departures) in P2P systems. The proactive failure recovery scheme maintains a small number of dynamically selected backup compositions to achieve quick failure recovery for soft realtime streaming applications. We have implemented a prototype of SpiderNet and conducted extensive experiments using both large-scale simulations and wide-area network testbed. Experimental results show the feasibility and efficiency of the SpiderNet service composition solution for P2P systems.},

This paper will describe an MG workflow management system with intelligent, multi-agent support in a dynamic Web environment. Intelligent agents work together individually and cooperate with each other to perform the appropriate tasks in the MG Workflow system. This service agent encapsulates a service that is associated with the manufacturing resources. With help from a multi-agent, the system can organize the work processes and dynamically schedule the services according to the QoS (Quality of Service) capabilities of the service agents.

abstract = {Self-adaptive software systems are those able to manage changing operating conditions dynamically and autonomously. Currently, most proposals in this field rely on an explicit representation of the constituent elements and goals of the system. This approach is suitable for systems where constituent elements are well known at design time. However, in systems where new elements may dynamically enter or leave the execution environment, it is not possible to obtain a predefined description of the system's architecture nor a complete specification of its goals. Paradigmatic examples of such systems can be found in ubiquitous computing, or dynamic web service discovery and composition, where new adaptability problems arise, such as the (dis)connection of unforeseen elements to an already running system, or ensuring properties of the composition among services, which cannot be addressed at static verification time since the state space of the system is not closed anymore. In this paper, we present our approach for the composition and resolution of interface mismatch among services in ubiquitous computing environments, dynamically reconfiguring the system as new services are integrated or disconnected.},

Indeed, QoS is becoming a crucial and a distinguishing criterion among functionally equivalent Web services. QoS Management consists of two complementary tasks: monitoring and adaptation. Both are very challenging because of the unpredictable and dynamic nature of Web service composition. In this paper, we propose a broker based architecture that enables dynamic QoS monitoring and adaptation for composite Web services. Our approach consists of dynamically changing the execution paths of composed Web services by instrumenting the BPEL process. We developed a prototype to evaluate the QoS adaptation scheme using our architecture and the result showed that the QoS of the BPEL process has been considerably adapted and improved comparing to the original one.},

abstract = {The variation of contexts in which a Web service could be used and the resulting variation in functional and quality of service (QoS) requirements motivates further research to extend Web services platforms to cater for differentiated service offerings and dynamic adaptability. Adaptability is an important requirement in the context of Web services to cater for the need of diverse set of client applications requesting customized view of consumed Web services to fit their own contexts and preferences. This paper presents an ongoing project to devise a novel service composition framework, named AdaptiveBPEL that leverages aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) techniques to open up the service composition for dynamic change in order to provide a greater degree of configurability and dynamic adaptability of Web services. This framework can: 1) easily adapt to changes in business rules, and collaboration policies governing service interactions; 2) provide different levels of functional and QoS offerings. The adaptation process is policy-driven to declaratively define the adaptive service behavior through dynamic injection of functional and non-functional extensions into a core service composition to allow on-demand and per-instance service adaptability.},

Due to the volatile nature of QoS parameters, QoS prediction has been put forward to understand the trend of QoS data volatility and estimate QoS values in dynamic environments. In order to provide adaptive and effective QoS prediction, we propose a WS QoS prediction approach, named WS-QoSP, based on the technique of forecast combination. Different from the existing QoS prediction approaches that choose a most feasible forecasting model and predict relying on this “best” model, WS-QoSP selects multiple potential forecasting models, combines the results of the selected models to optimize the overall forecast accuracy. Results of real data experiments demonstrate the diversified forecast accuracy gains by using WS-QoSP.},

It possesses the attributes of well encapsulation and loose coupling. With the prevailing of Web service, how to select a set of services among large body of services with the same function in order to make the Composite Web Service achieve better performance and better quality is a hot issue in recent research. At the same time, with the dynamic environment of the Internet and business, it is difficult to choose the better and more precise service for the simple and static service choice model .So the dynamic choice of web service is quite important for the task. AS the research of Web Service gets deeper and deeper, the single service can't meet the need of the client. As the result, the Composite Web Service which can provide value-added functions has received a lot of attentions. So, the Web Service Composition emerges as the times require. In the study of QoS thesis analyzes current QoS models' advantages and disadvantages, which proposes a new, objective, reliable QoS model called the Dynamic QoS model (D-QoS model). There is a way which supports the management in the thesis. The approach is based on genetic algorithm and uses the D-QoS model to solve the composite optimization, there is a diminutive system in which we could prove that the model is feasible and ensure the deep popularization of the model.},

abstract = {Service Oriented Architectures enable a multitude of Web services to provide loosely coupled and interoperable services at different Quality of Service level in the recent few years. This paper presents a framework to facilitate dynamic service composition, selection and adaptation of QoS-aware Web services. Considering both functional and QoS characteristics of Web services, this framework intends to generate the optimal travel process solutions for tourists in spite of their locations and preferences. For many Web services providing a similar functionality, our study primarily focus on the issue about services selection with multi-constraints. In this paper, we propose a Web service selection model with global constraints and design a Multi-choice, Multi- dimension genetic algorithm (MMGA) . Experimental results show that within a finite number of evolving generations this algorithm can generate a set of no dominated Pareto optimal solutions which satisfy to user's QoS requirements.},

abstract = {Web service composition (WSC) is a pop topic in service oriented architecture (SOA). Proper selection of the candidate Web services is a principal task in dynamic WSC, for it directly determines the composite quality of service (QoS). But most existing services selection methods use "best-effort" strategies to serve the service requesters. These strategies focus so heavily on requester's interests that brings inefficiency to resources, because the requesters greedily compete to get the "best" service. Besides, the impartiability of a composite service should not be ignored. Therefore, an "on-demand" services selection strategy is put forward by treating the service requesters and providers as buyers and sellers in commodity-market environment. And considering the integration of a composite service, the services selection is modeling as a 0-1 multidimensional knapsack problem. Furthermore, referring to "price-demand rule" in commodity-market, the services selection model is improved for resources load balance. Finally, experiments have shown that commodity-market based service selection can bring load balance and be helpful for resources utility.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Dynamic Composer for Web services. The services are enriched with semantic descriptions in OWL-S, based on which the Composer automatically creates a combination of services reaching a specified goal. As an example, a trip planning use case is chosen where the goal ranges from booking of a single flight to planning of an entire trip including flight, hotel, transport, etc. The composition is achieved using local and global algorithms satisfying specific quality of service (QoS) constraints and requirements such as the execution time or cost of the invoked Web services. At the same time a more extended HTN planning algorithm is discussed, matching not only service outputs to inputs but also satisfying service preconditions through effects. In addition to the automatic composition, the paper also proposes a recovery mechanism in case of unavailable services. When executing the composition of flight services, unavailable services are dynamically replaced by equivalent services or a new composition achieving the needed result. The presented platform and planning algorithms are put through extensive performance and scalability tests for typical trip booking scenarios, in which basic services are composed to a complex trip planning service.},

abstract = {Recently, Web services have become a new technology trend for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and more and more applications based on Web services are emerging. One of the problems in using Web services in business applications such as logistics is services composition automatically and efficiently. In this paper, we present a Dynamic, Demand-Driven Web services Engine called D3D-Serv to implement composite service functionality that is used to dynamically build composite services from existing services according to different business logics and requirements. In this D3D-Serv framework, the most challenging function to implement is dynamic selection of service providers at run time. The highly dynamic and distributed nature of Web services often makes some service providers overloaded at certain times while others idle. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient services selection and execution strategy that is based on the queuing theory and can provide guarantees for the QOS (Quality of Service) under provider's limited resources. Preliminary experimental results have shown that this algorithm is effective.},

However, the selection process is too greatly complicated to meet the requirement of business process. In this paper, the key business process performance model (KBPP) is proposed, and further, the issue of QoS driven service selection for dynamic web service composition is investigated. From the point of view of requirement of KBPP, an evaluation framework with KBPP is proposed, and a new approach to optimize the service selecting based on KBPP is presented.

In order to make the composite service adapt to such dynamic property of Web services, we propose a self-healing approach for web service composition. Such an approach is an integration of backing up in selection and reselecting in execution. In order to make the composite service heal itself as quickly as possible and minimize the number of reselections, a way of performance prediction is proposed in this paper. On this basis, the self-healing approach is presented including framework, the triggering algorithm of the reselection and the reliability model of the service. Experiments show that the proposed solutions have better performance in supporting the self-healing Web service composition.},

@article{He2008,
abstract = {Business processes consisting of component Web services are often executed in volatile environments where the quality of service parameters of the participating services might change during the execution of the business processes. Recently, research has been carried out on adapting composite Web service in volatile service-oriented computing environments. However, current approaches do not consider the internal logic of the business process and the impact of adaptation for a single service on the other component services. Other than quality of service parameters, effective adaptation requires specific information of the component services in terms of their position and interaction in the business process. The work reported in this paper is a first step in this direction. We present a novel approach to adaptation of Web service composition based on workflow patterns. This approach measures the value of changed information that updated services may potentially introduce in the business process. Experimental results show that our approach provides effective adaptation solutions by expanding the adaptation scope and considering the internal logic of business process.},

Furthermore, a rapid QoS calculation strategy of composite service is presented. Some important QoS calculation formulas are presented and proved. Based on the extended model and the QoS calculation strategy, a configuration with optimal QoS can be selected dynamically. The QoS of composite service is improved.

abstract = {The composition of Web Services to workflows is one of the major challenges in the area of service-oriented computing. To meet the business and user requirements, it is crucial to manage the quality of service (QoS) of Web Service workflows. In our approach, we calculate the execution plan of workflows on the QoS attributes ex ante based on predictions. However, due to the volatile nature of the Internet and the web servers, the runtime behavior of Web Services is likely to differ from the predictions. Therefore, we propose replanning as a mechanism to adapt the execution plan to the actual behavior of already executed services by a dynamic service selection at runtime, ensuring that the QoS and cost requirements will still be met. In this paper, we discuss replanning strategies, show how replanning leads to cost-savings in most cases, and evaluate the additional overhead caused by the adaptation of the execution plan at runtime.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;As cloud-based services become more numerous and dynamic, resource provisioning becomes more and more challenging. A QoS constrained resource allocation problem is considered in this paper, in which service demanders intend to solve sophisticated parallel computing problem by requesting the usage of resources across a cloud-based network, and a cost of each computational service depends on the amount of computation. Game theory is used to solve the problem of resource allocation. A practical approximated solution with the following two steps is proposed. First, each participant solves its optimal problem independently, without consideration of the multiplexing of resource assignments. A Binary Integer Programming method is proposed to solve the independent optimization. Second, an evolutionary mechanism is designed, which changes multiplexed strategies of the initial optimal solutions of different participants with minimizing their efficiency losses. The algorithms in the evolutionary mechanism take both optimization and fairness into account. It is demonstrated that Nash equilibrium always exists if the resource allocation game has feasible solutions.},

abstract = {Cloud computing offers users the ability to access large pools of computational and storage resources on demand. Multiple commercial clouds already allow businesses to replace, or supplement, privately owned IT assets, alleviating them from the burden of managing and maintaining these facilities. However, there are issues that must be addressed before this vision of utility computing can be fully realized. In existing systems, customers are charged based upon the amount of resources used or reserved, but no guarantees are made regarding the application level performance or quality-of-service (QoS) that the given resources will provide. As cloud providers continue to utilize virtualization technologies in their systems, this can become problematic. In particular, the consolidation of multiple customer applications onto multicore servers introduces performance interference between collocated workloads, significantly impacting application QoS. To address this challenge, we advocate that the cloud should transparently provision additional resources as necessary to achieve the performance that customers would have realized if they were running in isolation. Accordingly, we have developed Q-Clouds, a QoS-aware control framework that tunes resource allocations to mitigate performance interference effects. Q-Clouds uses online feedback to build a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model that captures performance interference interactions, and uses it to perform closed loop resource management. In addition, we utilize this functionality to allow applications to specify multiple levels of QoS as application Q-states. For such applications, Q-Clouds dynamically provisions underutilized resources to enable elevated QoS levels, thereby improving system efficiency. Experimental evaluations of our solution using benchmark applications illustrate the benefits: performance interference is mitigated completely when feasible, and system utilization is improved by up to 35\% using Q-states.},

abstract = {The skyrocketing demand for a new generation of cloud-based consumer and business applications is driving the need for next generation of datacenters that must be massively scalable, efficient, agile, reliable and secure. The authors see a parallel between the state of the datacenters today and the evolution of the Intelligent Network (IN) infrastructure in telecommunication. The telecommunications networks have for many years, demonstrated their ability to reliably enable network (voice) services creation, assurance and delivery on a massive scale. Based on an analysis of the Intelligent Networks in telecommunications to identify proven concepts and key lessons that can be applied to enable next generation IT datacenters experience this paper asserts that: In order to scale cloud services reliably to millions of service developers and billions of end users the next generation cloud computing and datacenter infrastructure will have to follow an evolution similar to the one that led to the creation of scalable telecommunication networks. In the future network-based cloud service providers will leverage virtualization technologies to be able to allocate just the right levels of virtualized compute, network and storage resources to individual applications based on real-time business demand while also providing full service level assurance of availability, performance and security at a reasonable cost. A key component - identified in this paper as the Virtual Resource Mediation Layer (VRML), must be developed through industry collaboration to enable interoperability of various public and private clouds. This layer will form the basis for ensuring massive scalability of cloud infrastructure by enabling distributed service creation, service delivery and service assurance without any single vendor domination. The next generation virtualization technologies must allow applications to dynamically access CPU, memory, bandwidth and storage (capacity, I/O and throughput) in a manner similar to that of the telecommunications 800 Service Call Model1 with one level of indirection and mediation. The authors believe that the next generation cloud evolution is a fundamental transformation and not just an evolutionary stack of XaaS implementations, which will enable global service collaboration networks utilizing optimally distributed and managed computing, network and storage resources driven in real-time by business priorities.},

abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing Storage Clouds for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

Here, the on-demand provisioning of computing resources is managed via a population of independent software agents that query and negotiate with one another in an open system of resource providers and consumers that has no fixed organisation and is free to change and grow organically. Where centralised executive control of agent activity is relaxed or removed, such systems have the potential to deliver scalable, flexible computing. However, major design and control challenges must be overcome if multi-agent systems are to achieve efficient, decentralised resource allocation that delivers reliable and robust performance. In this paper we introduce a minimally complex multi-agent system, where individual agents rely on simple, local strategies to perform resource allocation. We explore the relationship between local and global behaviour as system size, load, heterogeneity and reliability are varied. We identify generic feedbacks underlying system behaviour that must be balanced if decentralised control is to become an effective technique for preserving stable functionality across utility computing infrastructures.},

It is also an NP hard resource allocation and deployment problem, so many common grid and cloud computing libraries, such as MPICH and Hadoop, do not address this problem, even though large performance gains can occur by optimising communications between nodes. This paper provides four contributions to research on the component placement problem for grid and cloud computing environments. First, we present the multi-agent distributed adaptive resource allocation (MADARA) toolkit, which is designed to address grid and cloud allocation and deployment needs. Second, we present a heuristic called the comparison-based iteration by degree (CID) heuristic, which we use to approximate optimal deployments in MADARA. Third, we analyse the performance of applying the CID heuristic to approximate common grid and cloud operations, such as broadcast, gather and reduce. Fourth, we evaluate the results of applying genetic programming mutation to improve our CID heuristic.},

abstract = {Service-based systems that are dynamically composed at runtime to provide complex, adaptive functionality are currently one of the main development paradigms in software engineering. However, the Quality of Service (QoS) delivered by these systems remains an important concern, and needs to be managed in an equally adaptive and predictable way. To address this need, we introduce a novel, tool-supported framework for the development of adaptive service-based systems called QoSMOS (QoS Management and Optimization of Service-based systems). QoSMOS can be used to develop service-based systems that achieve their QoS requirements through dynamically adapting to changes in the system state, environment, and workload. QoSMOS service-based systems translate high-level QoS requirements specified by their administrators into probabilistic temporal logic formulae, which are then formally and automatically analyzed to identify and enforce optimal system configurations. The QoSMOS self-adaptation mechanism can handle reliability and performance-related QoS requirements, and can be integrated into newly developed solutions or legacy systems. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are validated using simulations and a set of experiments based on an implementation of an adaptive service-based system for remote medical assistance.},

However, this cloud computing is more involved in purchasing and consuming manners between providers and users than others. So how to allocate resources reasonably to cater requirements from both sides attracts wide attentions. Based on game theory, we introduce a new Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Allocation algorithm to solve resource management problem in cloud computing. This algorithm fully considers several criteria such as the heterogeneous distribution of resources, rational exchange behaviors of cloud users, incomplete common information and dynamic successive allocation. Compared to former researches, experimental results presented in this paper show that even though rivals’ information is uncertain, cloud users can receive Nash equilibrium allocation solutions by gambling stage by stage. Furthermore, the resource price evaluated by the algorithm will converge to the optimal price at the end of the gambling sequence.},

abstract = {Flexible and adaptive quality of service (QoS) is desirable for real-time multi- media applications. Suppose a multimedia system is supporting a 30 frame/second video stream which is using a network bandwidth of 2 Mbps, and due to network congestion the network bandwidth is reduced to 1 Mbps. It is desirable that the system supports graceful adaptation of quality of the video stream, for example, by reducing the frame rate to 15 frame/second. The focus of this dissertation is to investigate the design of an adaptive multimedia system (AMS) with multiple concurrent sessions, where the quality of individual sessions is dynamically adapted to the available resources and to the run-time user preferences. We propose the Utility Model a mathematical model to capture the issues of re- source management within multisession AMSs. In this model, each session provides a quality pro le, which is a set of operating qualities arranged from the minimum acceptable quality to the maximum desired quality. Any operating quality may be mapped to the required resources using a quality-resource mapping, and also to a session utility using a quality-utility mapping. The main problem in a multisession AMS is to nd an operating quality for each session such that the overall system util- ity (e.g. system revenue) is maximized under the system resource constraints. This is called the adaptive multimedia problem (AMP). The Utility Model formulates the AMP as the multiple-choice multi-dimension 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP). It provides a uni ed and computationally feasible way to solve the admission prob- lem for new multimedia sessions, and the dynamic quality adaptation and integrated resource allocation problems for existing sessions. We present the Padma Architecture a system architecture for multisession AMSs. This architecture has two novelties: (1) integrated and adaptive manage- ment of system resources based on the Utility Model, and (2) the use of metaspaces to encapsulate the machinery of quality adaptation. The former provides improved iii resource utilization and dynamic quality adaptation, and the latter provides the ap- plication programmers freedom from the concerns of low-level resource management issues while developing multimedia applications. Finally, we present the Utility Model Demonstration Prototype (UMDP) a prototype which demonstrates the capability of the Utility Model to handle admis- sion control, quality adaptation and integrated resource allocation in a uni ed way. We evaluate the performance of UMDP using random sequences of events, and show that the system utility achieved by the UMDP is signi cantly higher than that of a simple reservation model prototype (SRMP). For applications such multimedia ser- vice providers, it means that UMDP will generate more revenue than SRMP from the same amounts of system resources provisioned.},

It lies at the core of all interactions between the entities that have to operate in such uncertain and constantly changing environments. Given this complexity, these components, and the ensuing system, are increasingly being conceptualised, designed, and built using agent-based techniques and, to this end, this paper examines the specific role of trust in multi-agent systems. In particular, we survey the state of the art and provide an account of the main directions along which research efforts are being focused. In so doing, we critically evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the main models that have been proposed and show how, fundamentally, they all seek to minimise the uncertainty in interactions.

abstract = {There is little or no guidance to systematically design a self-organising emergent solution that achieves the desired macroscopic behaviour. This paper describes decentralised coordination mechanisms such as gradient fields as design patterns, similar to patterns used in mainstream software engineering. As a consequence, a structured consolidation of best practice in using each coordination mechanism becomes available to guide engineers in applying them, and to directly decide which mechanisms are promising to solve a certain problem. As such, self-organising emergent solutions can be engineered more systematically, which is illustrated in a packet delivery service application.},

HMAS are based upon self-similar entities, called holons, which define an organizational structure called holarchy. An open issue of HMAS is to give holons means of self-organization to satisfy their goals. Our works focus on modeling and engineering of complex systems using a holonic organizational approach. This paper introduces the concept of capacity as the description of agents know-how. This concept allows the representation and reasoning about agents know-hows. Even more, it encourages a reusable modeling and provides agents with means to self-organize.},

Aimed at graduate students and professionals in economics, the volume provides the most up-to-date analysis of traditional theories of "optimal auctions" as well as newer theories of multi-unit auctions and package auctions, and shows by example how these theories are used. It explores the limitations of prominent older designs, such as the Vickrey auction design, and evaluates the practical responses to those limitations.

abstract = {In service-oriented systems, Quality of Service represents an important issue which is often considered when selecting and composing services. For receiving up-to-date information, non-functional properties such as response time or availability can be continuously monitored using server- or client- side approaches. However, both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present a framework that combines the advantages of client- and server-side QoS monitoring. It builds on event processing to inform interested subscribers of current QoS values and possible violations of Service Level Agreements. These events can trigger adaptive behavior such as hosting new service instances if the QoS is not as desired. We describe our QoS monitoring approach in detail, show how it was integrated into the VRESCo service runtime environment, and evaluate the accuracy of the presented monitoring techniques.},

@article{Zeng2007,
abstract = {Quality of Service (QoS) information for Web services is essential to QoS-aware service management and composition. Currently, most QoS-aware solutions assume that the QoS for component services is readily available, and that the QoS for composite services can be computed from the QoS for component services. The issue of how to obtain the QoS for component services has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we tackle this fundamental issue. We argue that most of QoS metrics can be observed/computed based on service operations. We present the design and implementation of a high-performance QoS monitoring system. The system is driven by a QoS observation model that defines IT- and business-level metrics and associated evaluation formulas. Integrated into the SOA infrastructure at large, the monitoring system can detect and route service operational events systemically. Further, a model-driven, hybrid compilation/interpretation approach is used in metric computation to process service operational events and maintain metrics efficiently. Experiments suggest that our system can support high event processing throughput and scales to the number of CPUs.},

abstract = {Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the level of service that a service provider must deliver. An SLA is a contract between service provider and consumer, and includes appropriate actions to be taken upon violation of the contractual obligations. However, implementing an SLA using existing IT infrastructure is difficult, requiring a lot of manual effort to translate an SLA into code, model it with the given programming language, and ensure the required monitoring support is available for efficient monitoring and tracking of the SLAs. In this paper, we present a solution for modeling an SLA contract. It is designed to be configurable, reusable, extensible and inheritable, thus providing great flexibility to construct complex SLAs. We also introduce an algorithmic generation pattern to create the necessary artifacts to implement an SLA presented in this paper. The resulting artifacts automatically monitor a business process and evaluate whether the SLA is violated during runtime execution. The proposed approach is designed to require minimal human intervention.},

@article{Lodi2007a,
abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a middleware architecture for enabling service level agreement (SLA)-driven clustering of QoS-aware application servers. Our middleware architecture supports application server technologies with dynamic resource management: application servers can dynamically change the amount of clustered resources assigned to hosted applications on-demand so as to meet application-level quality of service (QoS) requirements. These requirements can include timeliness, availability, and high throughput and are specified in SLAs. A prototype of our architecture has been implemented using the open-source J2EE application server JBoss. The evaluation of this prototype shows that our approach makes possible JBoss' resource usage optimization and allows JBoss to effectively meet the QoS requirements of the applications it hosts, i.e., to honor the SLAs of those applications},

abstract = {SLAng is an XML language for defining service level agreements, the part of a contract between the client and provider of an Internet service that describes the quality attributes that the service is required to possess. We define the semantics of SLAng precisely by modelling the syntax of the language in UML, then relating the language model to a model that describes the structure and behaviour of services. The presence of SLAng elements imposes behavioural constraints on service elements, and the precise definition of these constraints using OCL constitutes the semantic description of the language. We use the semantics to define a notion of SLA compatibility, and an extension to UML that enables the modelling of service situations as a precursor to analysis, implementation and provisioning activities.},
